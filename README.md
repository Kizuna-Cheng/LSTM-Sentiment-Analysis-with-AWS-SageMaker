# LSTM-Sentiment-Analysis-with-AWS-SageMaker

## Project Overview

In this project, I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deployed the model and constructed a simple web app which can interact with the deployed model.

The deployment part of the project is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform.
